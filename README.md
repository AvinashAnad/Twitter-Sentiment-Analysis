# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This is a text analysis and sentiment classification project on data collected from microblogging platform twitter.com. I used tweepy API to collected 5490 tweets on the topic 'Wonder Woman'(the movie) and performed some basic exploratory data analysis on the tweets objects. I also performed sentiment classification on the tweets. Since this is my first sentiment analysis project, your comments and constructive critisizm are most welcome.
